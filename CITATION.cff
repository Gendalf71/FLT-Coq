abstract: >
  Two closely-related Coq formalizations showing conditional routes to Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem:
  (A) a coverage-parameter approach with a global normalizer o>1 and maximum-coverage
  principle; (B) an explicit-base hypothesis GN(2). In both tracks, the added premise is
  assumed (not proven). The repository focuses on reproducibility (CI, Docker one-liner) and
  an automated check ensuring there are no 'Admitted.'.
